	/// the state manager identifies the active <see cref="IStateful"/>
	/// instances and instructs them to save or restore state.
	/// For example, if the application navigates
	/// away from a page and that page's view-model
	/// implements <see cref="IStateful"/>, then
	/// the state manager informs that object that is should
	/// save its state. Conversely, if the app navigates to
	/// a page whose view-model implements <see cref="IStateful"/>
	/// then the state manager provides the view-model
	/// with an opportunity to restore its state.
